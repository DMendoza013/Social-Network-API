# Social-Network-API

## Description

This project is an API for a social media network where users share their thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and make a friend list. Data is stored and updated using a MongoDB database. MonogoDb is a good database for storing and accessing lots of unstructured data. The main purpose was to practice creating a database that could handle large amounts of data.
